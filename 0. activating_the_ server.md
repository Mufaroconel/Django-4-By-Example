The activation process for a Django project on macOS is very similar to the process described earlier. Here are the steps specifically for macOS:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to your project directory. You can use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:
   ```
   cd /path/to/your/django_project
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment. If you're using `virtualenv`, you'd typically run:
   ```
   source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate
   ```
   If you're using `venv` (built-in to Python 3), you might run:
   ```
   source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/your/venv` with the actual path to your virtual environment.
4. Once the virtual environment is activated, navigate to your Django project directory containing `manage.py`.
5. Run the Django development server using the `manage.py` script:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

After running these commands, your Django project should be activated, and you should be able to access it in your web browser by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` or `http://localhost:8000/` by default, unless you've specified a different host or port.
