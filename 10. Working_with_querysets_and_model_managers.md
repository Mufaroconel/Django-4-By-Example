# Working with Query Sets and model managers
A
**Original Django Code:**

```python
from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404

def post_detail(request, slug):
    post = get_object_or_404(Post, slug=slug)
    context = {'post': post}
    return render(request, 'blog/post_detail.html', context)
```

**Converted Markdown with Explanation:**

```markdown
**Function:** `post_detail(request, slug)`

* **Imports:** This line imports necessary functions from `django.shortcuts`:
    * `render`: Used to render templates and return the response.
    * `get_object_or_404`: Retrieves an object from the database or raises a 404 error if not found.
* **Retrieving Post:** This line fetches a specific post object using `get_object_or_404`. It searches for a `Post` model instance with a matching `slug` value and raises an error if not found.
* **Creating Context:** This line creates a dictionary named `context` to hold data to be passed to the template. It includes the retrieved `post` object.
* **Rendering Template:** This line renders the `blog/post_detail.html` template using the `render` function. It passes the `context` dictionary containing the post data to the template for display.

**Key Point:** This code defines a view function that handles requests for individual blog post details. It retrieves the appropriate post based on the URL slug, prepares data for the template, and renders the detail template.
```

Now that we have a fully functional administration site to manage blog posts, it is a good time to learn how to read and write content to the database programmatically.
The Django object-relational mapper (ORM) is a powerful database abstraction API that lets you create, retrieve, update, and delete objects easily. An ORM allows you to generate SQL queries using the object-oriented paradigm of Python. You can think of it as a way to interact with your database in pythonic fashion instead of writing raw SQL queries.
The ORM maps your models to database tables and provides you with a simple pythonic interface to interact with your database. The ORM generates SQL queries and maps the results to model objects. The Django ORM is compatible with MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, and MariaDB.
`Remember that you can define the database of your project in the DATABASES setting of your project’s settings.py file`. Django can work with multiple databases at a time, and you can program database routers to create custom data routing schemes.
Once you have created your data models, Django gives you a free API to interact with them. You can find the data model reference of the official documentation at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/models/.
The Django ORM is based on QuerySets. A QuerySet is a collection of database queries to retrieve objects from your database. You can apply filters to QuerySets to narrow down the query results based on given parameters.

# Creating objects

Run the following command in the shell prompt to open the Python shell:
```
python manage.py shell
```
Then, type the following lines:

>>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
>>> from blog.models import Post
>>> user = User.objects.get(username='admin')
>>> post = Post(title='Another post',
...             slug='another-post',
...             body='Post body.',
...             author=user)
>>> post.save()

Let’s analyze what this code does.

First, we are retrieving the user object with the username admin:

user = User.objects.get(username='admin')

The get() method allows you to retrieve a single object from the database. Note that this method expects a result that matches the query. If no results are returned by the database, this method will raise a DoesNotExist exception, and if the database returns more than one result, it will raise a MultipleObjectsReturned exception. Both exceptions are attributes of the model class that the query is being performed on.
Then, we are creating a Post instance with a custom title, slug, and body, and set the user that we previously retrieved as the author of the post:

post = Post(title='Another post', slug='another-post', body='Post body.', author=user)

This object is in memory and not persisted to the database; we created a Python object that can be used during runtime but that is not saved into the database.
Finally, we are saving the Post object to the database using the save() method:
post.save()

The preceding action performs an INSERT SQL statement behind the scenes.
We created an object in memory first and then persisted it to the database. You can also create the object and persist it into the database in a single operation using the create() method, as follows:
```
Post.objects.create(title='One more post',
                    slug='one-more-post',
                    body='Post body.',
                    author=user)
```

# Updating objects

Now, change the title of the post to something different and save the object again:

>>> post.title = 'New title'
>>> post.save()

This time, the save() method performs an UPDATE SQL statement.

# Retrieving objects

You already know how to retrieve a single object from the database using the get() method. We accessed this method using Post.objects.get(). Each Django model has at least one manager, and the default manager is called objects. You get a QuerySet object using your model manager.
To retrieve all objects from a table, we use the all() method on the default objects manager, like this:
>>> all_posts = Post.objects.all()

This is how we create a QuerySet that returns all objects in the database. Note that this QuerySet has not been executed yet. Django QuerySets are lazy, which means they are only evaluated when they are forced to. This behavior makes QuerySets very efficient. If you don’t assign the QuerySet to a variable but instead write it directly on the Python shell, the SQL statement of the QuerySet is executed because you are forcing it to generate output:
>>> Post.objects.all()
<QuerySet [<Post: Who was Django Reinhardt?>, <Post: New title>]>

Using the filter() method
To filter a QuerySet, you can use the filter() method of the manager. For example, you can retrieve all posts published in the year 2022 using the

following QuerySet:
>>> Post.objects.filter(publish__year=2022)

You can also filter by multiple fields. For example, you can retrieve all posts published in 2022 by the author with the username admin:
>>> Post.objects.filter(publish__year=2022, author__username='admin')

This equates to building the same QuerySet chaining multiple filters:
>>> Post.objects.filter(publish__year=2022) \
>>>             .filter(author__username='admin')

# Using exclude

You can exclude certain results from your QuerySet using the exclude() method of the manager. For example, you can retrieve all posts published in 2022 whose titles don’t start with Why:
>>> Post.objects.filter(publish__year=2022) \
>>>             .exclude(title__startswith='Why')

# Using order_by()
You can order results by different fields using the order_by() method of the manager. For example, you can retrieve all objects ordered by their title, as follows:
>>> Post.objects.order_by('title')

## Ascending order is implied. You can indicate descending order with a negative sign prefix, like this:
>>> Post.objects.order_by('-title')


# Deleting objects
If you want to delete an object, you can do it from the object instance using the delete() method:
>>> post = Post.objects.get(id=1)
>>> post.delete()

Note that deleting objects will also delete any dependent relationships for ForeignKey objects defined with on_delete set to CASCADE.

When QuerySets are evaluated
Creating a QuerySet doesn’t involve any database activity until it is evaluated. QuerySets usually return another unevaluated QuerySet. You can concatenate as many filters as you like to a QuerySet, and you will not hit the database until the QuerySet is evaluated. When a QuerySet is evaluated, it translates into an SQL query to the database.
QuerySets are only evaluated in the following cases:

The first time you iterate over them
When you slice them, for instance, Post.objects.all()[:3]
When you pickle or cache them
When you call repr() or len() on them
When you explicitly call list() on them
When you test them in a statement, such as bool(), or, and, or if

“Creating model managers
The default manager for every model is the objects manager. This manager retrieves all the objects in the database. However, we can define custom managers for models. 
Let’s create a custom manager to retrieve all posts that have a PUBLISHED status.
There are two ways to add or customize managers for your models: you can add extra manager methods to an existing manager or create a new manager by modifying the initial QuerySet that the manager returns. The first method provides you with a QuerySet notation like Post.objects.my_manager(), and the latter provides you with a QuerySet notation like Post.my_manager.all(). 
We will choose the second method to implement a manager that will allow us to retrieve posts using the notation Post.published.all().
Edit the models.py file of your blog application to add the custom manager as follows. The new lines are highlighted in bold:
class PublishedManager(models.Manager):
    def get_queryset(self):
        return super().get_queryset()\
                     .filter(status=Post.Status.PUBLISHED)
class Post(models.Model):
    # model fields
    “class Post(models.Model):
    # model fields
    # ...
    objects = models.Manager() # The default manager.
    published = PublishedManager() # Our custom manager.
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-publish']
    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

The first manager declared in a model becomes the default manager. You can use the Meta attribute default_manager_name to specify a different default manager. If no manager is defined in the model, Django automatically creates the objects default manager for it. If you declare any managers for your model, but you want to keep the objects manager as well, you have to add it explicitly to your model. In the preceding code, we have added the default objects manager and the published custom manager to the Post model.
The get_queryset() method of a manager returns the QuerySet that will be executed. We have overridden this method to build a custom QuerySet that filters posts by their status and returns a successive QuerySet that only includes posts with the PUBLISHED status.
We have now defined a custom manager for the Post model. Let’s test it!
Start the development server again with the following command in the shell prompt:
```
python manage.py shell
```
