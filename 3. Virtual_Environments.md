# Creating python virtual environments
f you are using Linux or macOS, create an isolated environment with the following command:

* python -m venv my_venv *

Remember to use python3 instead of python if your system comes with Python 2 and you installed Python 3.
If you are using Windows, use the following command instead:

py -m venv my_venv

“This will use the Python launcher in Windows.
The previous command will create a Python environment in a new directory named my_env/. Any Python libraries you install while your virtual environment is active will go into the my_env/lib/python3.10/site-packages directory.
If you are using Linux or macOS, run the following command to activate your virtual environment:

source my_env/bin/activate

If you are using Windows, use the following command instead:
.\my_env\Scripts\activate

The shell prompt will include the name of the active virtual environment enclosed in parentheses like this:
(my_env) zenx@pc:~ zenx$

You can deactivate your environment at any time with the deactivate command. You can find more information about venv at https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.xhtml.”
